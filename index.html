        <h3>What is a Cookie?</h3>
        <p>
            Trackware is a program or data that can be used by a third party to identify a user
            or computer. The most commonly used trackware is a Tracking Cookie - a small piece of
            data that identifies a certain user or a certain computer, with the help of a web
            browser configured to store cookies. Certain programs are also used as trackware for
            portable computer systems, as a form of protection against theft. Cookies are not malware
            and are not inherently malicious - they do not harm the computer system or the user's
            stored information. Due to privacy concerns however, they are often unwanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Normally, when a user visits a website, the site saves a small text file, known as a
            cookie, onto the user's system. This file identifies the user as a unique visitor to
            that site and contains a 'record' of the actions performed or preferences set during
            the visit, for example, the last page viewed or the saved contents of the user's online
            "shopping cart". If the user later returns, the site can then 'read' the saved cookie
            and display the appropriate content. Unlike a normal cookie, a tracking cookie can be
            used by more than one site. Because a single tracking cookie may contain a history of
            the user's actions on multiple sites, if these cookies are misused or exploited the saved
            information may be used to analyze the user's web browsing behavior.

        <h4>The Good</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Conveniency:</b> Cookies not only remember which websites you have been to, they
                also remember information about forms. Filling out your address every time you buy
                something online gets old quickly. Cookies can make filling out address forms quick
                and efficient. Most online shopping websites nowadays allow cookies for address
                and email information but make you fill out your credit card information each time
                for security purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Personalization:</b> Cookies are great for serving up personalized content
                that is geared towards that specific user’s preferences. Amazon uses cookies to offer
                you related products, Google uses cookies to better understand your searches, and
                Facebook uses cookies to do just about everything.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Effective Advertising:</b> How nice would it be to only be offered products or
                services that are relevant to you? Internet marketing companies collect data from
                cookies to run marketing campaigns aimed at a very specific market segment including
                product group, geolocation, search term, and demographics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ease of Control:</b> It is actually really easy to manage your cookies if you know
                how. Most browsers make it easy for you to clear your browsing history. Cookies are
                stored on your hard drive in a text file under cookie.txt usually, and since it is a
                text file you can use just about any viewer or text editor to display, edit, and delete
                them.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Bad</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Privacy:</b> The main concern for most users is privacy. Cookie enabled web browsers
            keep track of all the websites you have visited. This means that with permission, third
            parties can access the information stored by these cookies. These third parties can be
            advertisers, other users, or even the government in some cases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Security:</b> Cookie security is a large problem. The concern is that many security
            holes have been found in different browsers. Some of these holes were so serious that they
            allowed malicious webmasters to gain access to users’ email, different passwords, and
            credit card information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Secrecy:</b> Although third party cookies can be blocked through your browser settings,
            most people don’t have the technical expertise to do this. Most browsers purposely make it
            difficult to find this setting in order to prevent you from turning them off. No cookies
            mean no data, which in turn means less money.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Are Cookies Ethical?</h4>
        <p>
            In my personal opinion, cookies are not an invasion of privacy and they are ethical. Because
            cookies do not do anything to harm your computer, and are just a piece of data, I feel that
            they should continue to be allowed for use. It is not the program that is malicious, it's the
            span of potentially malicious people that use it for an evil agenda.
